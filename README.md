Cats vs Dogs Image Classification (TensorFlow)

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. It was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning curriculum and demonstrates an end-to-end image classification pipeline.

Overview

Built a binary image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras

Applied image preprocessing and data augmentation to improve generalization

Designed and trained a CNN with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers

Evaluated model performance using validation data and unseen test images

Key Features

Image resizing and normalization

Data augmentation (rotation, shifting, flipping, zooming)

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture

Binary classification using sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Dataset

The dataset is provided by freeCodeCamp and consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, split into training, validation, and test sets.

Purpose

This project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate practical application of deep learning techniques for computer vision tasks.
